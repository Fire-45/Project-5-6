    <p> Hi! This is about how one of my favorite hobbies is reading,
      I like reading because whatever it says in the book
      I try and imagine it in my head, which alows me to picture each character of the story and what the plot is, where they are, and what they are doing and stuff like that. Authors often keep the story on a cliffhanger, which makes it more interesting, because you never know what is going to happen next. That's why I never like to re read books, unless I forgot what happens or I just want to picture that scene in my head again.
